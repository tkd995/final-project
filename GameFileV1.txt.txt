To Run: Download all the folders and run MyFirstGame.uproject and click open with unreal editor. Once the unreal editor is launched click the green play button to run the game.

Use Unreal Editor 5.2 or above to open the game.

I am working on building a different environment/map for the game. For now, i have used the default fps environment in unreal editor.
