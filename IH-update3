3 hours of research/lit review: Firstly scapy, a great tokenizer library, usable locally too; then a few of open ai's papers but they didn't offer as much insight as I had hoped; then I read a paper on human communication and how we generate it in the brain; finally I am reading through google's LLM teaching program.
