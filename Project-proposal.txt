(15 points) September 24, 2024: a 1-page project proposal, emailed to Dr.
Emrich (not emailed to the TAs, not uploaded to Canvas). The proposal should
name the team members, describe the software to be developed, outline the
solution, and list any concerns or special needs. You should consider this a
proposed contract.

Members: Ian Henson and Ashwin ____

Software Ideas: 
1. Converting Zim archives and traversing this information for AI information storage and recall
2. A genetic game of life
3. Anticheat that isn't intrusive

Expanding on Ideas:
1. Enumerate through zim files, create a disjoint set of linked pages, from there use NLP to combine the information on each page into a directed graph, use this graph for a generative text model to understand what wods mean in the context of others.
  - This is ideally to reflect how humnas perceive language
2. Create a game using Unity that generates starting creatures using a genetic seed code, then observe how these creatures procreate, mutate, and compete for finite resources
3. Anticheat software based on client side behavior and the server's observed behavior, allowing for better crossplatform support
